            <p>For this project, I decided to create an educational video about my favorite animal, The Red Panda using iMovie and iStock photos. I started by looking for resources to get information about the Red Panda to write my script. Then, using iStock, I found images that represented red pandas in their natural habitats, eating, foraging, and sleeping. I recorded myself practicing the script so I could time out each of the sections. For the video editing, I used iMovie and uploaded all of the pictures from iStock into the project. Then I put the images in the following order to organize my information: introduction, physical description and size, reproduction, habitat, food, sleeping, and lifespan. I then added transitions to separate the pictures after lengthening each clip to fit the specific times I needed. Next, I added the titles and text for the subtitles to the images. After organizing the structure of the pictures, transitions, and timings, I inserted the "Forest" ambiance sound effect found on iMovie. I adjusted the volume level of the forest sound effect to 20 so that it would be low in the background. Next, I recorded my script in iMovie by clicking the microphone icon. After recording, I adjusted the volume of my narration to make sure it would be loud enough.</p>
