            <p>For this project, I transformed a image of a flame into a GIF and then created a video about how early humans used fire to survive. </p>
            <br>
            <p>For the fire image, I used both Canva and PowerPoint. I imported the fire image to a blank presentation.  Then I updated the picture effect of the fire image by adding a bottom left offset shadow. I then made 2 copies of the flame so that I would have 3 flame images of different sizes. With image 1, I added blink and teeter animations to the image, changed the timing of the image to 0.5-second duration, and repeated it until the end of the slide.  For image 2, I clicked Animation Painter so that the same animations from image 1 would transfer to image 2. Then, I changed the setting so that the image effect would start with the previous image and changed the delay to 0.25 seconds. For image 3, I repeated the steps I completed for image 2, but I updated the duration to 1 minute and the delay to 0.5 seconds. To create the overlay of the 3 images so it would display from the smallest image to the largest, I sent image 3 all the way to the back, and then sent image 2 backward, before I laid all three images on top of each other.  I wrapped up this part of the project by testing the flame animation and then exported it as an animated GIF.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To create the entire presentation with my other images and text, I used PowerPoint. I uploaded a cave background and uploaded the flame GIF in the middle of the slide. I then added another flame image to go behind the flame GIF to fill it out and provide the campfire sticks under the flame GIF. I then found 3 images of early people that would depict my 3 topics of early using fire (warmth, food and light) and added the 3 subtitles. I then added timed transitions and animations (about 4.5 seconds each) between each image and subtitle to make each image/subtitle appear and disappear.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After I completed the PowerPoint presentation, I uploaded the mp4 to iMovie to edit the project. I found a fire-cracking mp3 and uploaded it to my video's background. Using my transcript, which included information about how fire impacted the lives of early people through warmth, food, and light, I recorded the audio for the video. After trimming the audio, and background music, I exported the file to mp4 and then uploaded it to Youtube.</p>
