            <p>For the digital book cover, I created a montage to form a composite illustration of my favorite book Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen. While there have been many remakes of the book into movies and regardless of how much I love Colin Firth, I chose to use images from the version of the movie remake featuring Keira Knightley. The first layer I added was the one that shows the images of the first intimate interactions between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy at the ball. With this image, I chose to transform the size so that it takes up most of the poster because I think this was one of the turning points in the character’s relationship with each other, especially from the viewpoint of Mr. Darcy. The image was a little darker than I wanted it to be, so I lightened up the transparency just a bit so the contrast would not be as sharp and it would appear a bit more whimsical. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The second layer I added was the image including the title of the book with regency caricatures. This image was transparent with no background so as to not interfere with the images in the first layer. I transformed the image so that it was big enough to be read but small enough to fit between the two images of Elizabeth pondering over her various interactions with Mr. Darcy. The next layer I added was the black heart which I used to represent the love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I used the color tool to select the color black and then inverted to get rid of the background so that all that would be left would be the heart. I then reduced the size of the image to fit in the upper corner of the poster. I then lessened the opacity of the black heart to 86 so that it could blend more into the background. </p>

<p>For the Logo, I pretended as if I were creating an educational company that guides educators in creating learning experiences designed for students rooted in Universal Design for Learning and Culturally Sustaining pedagogy.</p>
