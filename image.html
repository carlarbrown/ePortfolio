            <p>For the digital book cover, I created a montage to form a composite illustration of my favorite book Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen. While there have been many remakes of the book into movies and regardless of how much I love Colin Firth, I chose to use images from the version of the movie remake featuring Keira Knightley. The first layer I added was the one that shows the images of the first intimate interactions between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy at the ball. With this image, I chose to transform the size so that it takes up most of the poster because I think this was one of the turning points in the character’s relationship with each other, especially from the viewpoint of Mr. Darcy. The image was a little darker than I wanted it to be, so I lightened up the transparency just a bit so the contrast would not be as sharp and it would appear a bit more whimsical.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The second layer I added was the image including the title of the book with regency caricatures. This image was transparent with no background so as to not interfere with the images in the first layer. I transformed the image so that it was big enough to be read but small enough to fit between the two images of Elizabeth pondering over her various interactions with Mr. Darcy. The next layer I added was the black heart which I used to represent the love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I used the color tool to select the color black and then inverted to get rid of the background so that all that would be left would be the heart. I then reduced the size of the image to fit in the upper corner of the poster. I then lessened the opacity of the black heart to 86 so that it could blend more into the background.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fourth layer was the image of the hand. This represents the famous scene in the movie where Mr. Darcy helps Elizabeth into the carriage and flexes his hand afterward as if it burned him to touch her but in a good way. Once again, I transformed the size of the image to fit inside of the heart and rotated the image so that the fingers were facing down. I lassoed the area of the hand to make it stand out and then I reduced the opacity of the image to 36 so that it would blend into the heart. The last layer I added was a text layer with my favorite quote from the book “In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” I chose to include this quote because it represents the turmoil Mr. Darcy is going through with his emotions and feelings towards Elizabeth. I chose Edwardian Script because I think that font fits the time period.</p>

<p>For this Logo, I pretended as if I were creating an educational company that guides educators in creating learning experiences designed for students rooted in Universal Design for Learning and Culturally Sustaining pedagogy. This company would be guided by the philosophy of educational equity which is focused on each student receiving what they need to develop to their full academic and social potential. That is how I got the title “Just for Me”.</p>
<br>
<p>My subtitle “Building curriculum with the K-12 learner in mind” was influenced by the intersection of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy (CSP). UDL comes from neuroscience and its framework provides teachers and students with the language for advocacy and agency regarding engagement, representation, and expression for expert learners.  When teachers and students talk about their unique variabilities as learners, they create a space where they can advocate for what they need to achieve their goals, enacting agency over their own experiences as expert learners. CSP comes from educational anthropological research and encourages teachers and students to talk about how culture is at play in their work, including within the curriculum, among each other, and in the communities in which they come together.  CSP explicitly articulates these issues which are only implied in the UDL framework but could undermine the effectiveness of UDL implementation if not included in how teachers and students engage with the curriculum and their relationships in their context.</p>

<p>Influenced by Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop, who published “Mirrors, Windows and Sliding Glass Doors” in 1990, I used the two rectangle shapes to create the illusion of a mirror on the right side, a window on the left, and sliding doors in the middle. Windows allow students to see the experiences and realities of other people and cultures. Mirrors allow students to see one’s self and to put personal knowledge and experience into context. Lastly, the sliding doors allow students to enter into the lived experiences and realities of others. For the shapes, I used one rectangle with no fill and adjusted the stroke style to add the dotted borders to represent accessibility. I also adjusted the direction of the rectangles to symbolize doors being opened. To make the mirror reflection in the second rectangle, I duplicated the first rectangle and adjusted the gradient of the color fill. I then turned it in the opposite direction of the first rectangle. The arrow in the middle of the logo represents the path forward for students where they are able to access learning. To create the arrow, I used the pen tool to create the three lines and adjusted the two smaller lines diagonally to create the tips of the arrow. I put the title and subtitle underneath the arrow to symbolize taking the path forward into a space of educational equity. Lastly, there is so much complexity in creating this type of learning experience for students, so I chose to keep the color scheme as simple as possible with just black, white, and gradients of grey to not take away from the message.</p>
